# Day_Trip_Planner

## Description
Have you ever had multiple places to go in a day and wanted to know the best way to visit all of them? This happens each day for tourists. With this project, I aim to solve this problem by implementing the Travelling Salesman Problem to **New York City tourist attractions**. This project, of course, can be extrapolated to any set of locations, so long as they are written in a dataframe in the format that I used.
